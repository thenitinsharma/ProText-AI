## 📜 Introduction  
**ProText-AI** is your secret weapon against sounding unprofessional in workplace communications. This Chrome extension transforms your hastily typed, emoji-filled messages into polished, corporate-approved prose with just one click.  

Why pay $5 to the Chrome Web Store gatekeepers when you can deploy this extension yourself in under 5 minutes? That's a whole $5 you can put toward your coffee fund!

## ✨ Features  
✅ **One-click conversion** from casual to professional tone  
✅ **Works on any website** with text inputs (email, LinkedIn, Slack, etc.)  
✅ **Powered by Google's Gemini AI** (using your own API key, because privacy!)  
✅ **Minimalist black & white design** that won't make your browser look like a clown car  
✅ **FREE to use** (take THAT, Chrome Web Store!)

## 🚀 Installation Guide for the Chrome Store Rebels  

### **Step 1: Clone the Repository of Freedom**  
Already saved $5! That's like 45% of an avocado toast!  

### **Step 2: Load the Extension Like a Digital Outlaw**  
1. Open **Chrome** (yes, the irony isn't lost on us)  
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`  
3. Toggle on **"Developer mode"** in the top right corner (the REAL developer mode, not the $5 version)  
4. Click **"Load unpacked"**  
5. Select your cloned **ProMessage** folder  

🎉 **Congratulations!** You've successfully circumvented Big Tech's toll booth!

### **Step 3: Get Your Own Gemini API Key**  
1. Visit **Google AI Studio**  
2. Sign in with your **Google account**  
3. Create a new **API key** (still free... for now)  
4. Copy your **API key**  

---

### **Step 4: Configure ProText-AI**  
1. Click on the **ProText-AI** extension icon in your Chrome toolbar  
2. Paste your **Gemini API key** in the field  
3. Click **"Save"**  
4. Enjoy a smug sense of satisfaction

## 🔧 How to Use  
1. Click into any **text field** where your professional reputation is on the line  
2. Type your message in whatever **casual, abbreviation-filled style** you normally use  
3. Click the floating **✨ button** that appears in the bottom right of your screen  
4. Watch in amazement as your text transforms from:  
   - **"yo whats up with that report"** → **"I'm writing to inquire about the status of the quarterly analysis..."**  
5. Send with confidence, knowing you sound like a consummate professional

## 🧩 Why This Is Better Than the Chrome Web Store Version  
✅ **$5 richer**: Buy yourself a fancy coffee instead of paying Chrome's developer fee  
✅ **Full control**: Modify the code to make it even more awesome (or break it completely)  
✅ **Privacy**: Your API key and messages never pass through anyone else's servers  
✅ **Instant updates**: No waiting for Chrome Web Store approval process  
✅ **Tech cred**: Casually mention *"Oh, I just deploy my browser extensions directly from source"* at parties

## 🛠️ Customization  
Want to tweak the extension? Here are the important files:  

- **`content.js`** → Controls the floating button and text conversion process  
- **`background.js`** → Handles API calls to Gemini  
- **`options.html`** → The settings page for your API key  
- **`manifest.json`** → Extension configuration (**don't break this one**)  

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting  

### ❓ **Q: The floating button isn't appearing!**  
✅ **A:** Make sure you've **allowed the extension on all sites**.  
- Right-click the extension icon → **Manage Extensions** → **Site access** → **"On all sites"**  

### ❓ **Q: My conversions aren't working!**  
✅ **A:** Double-check your **API key**. Also, make sure you're not trying to professionalize text that's already painfully corporate.  

### ❓ **Q: Chrome is warning me about using developer mode extensions!**  
✅ **A:** That's just Chrome trying to shame you into paying the $5. **Stand strong!**
